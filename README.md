##Music, Together.

Host a playlist on Toadfish that guests can join and add songs to just by clicking a link.

Guest are happy that they contribute to the musical experience and you can enjoy the party.

Build playlist with songs from Soundcloud, Rdio, and Youtube so no more jumping between applications.

##About

Toadfish allows users to make ‘rooms’ that host a playlist that others can add to by simply following a shared link.  I saw that at gatherings I was attending, guests would huddle around the laptop playing music, fighting over the next song instead of enjoying the party.  This made no sense to me, especially since each one of us is carrying around a small computer in our pockets (we call them cellphones) capable of sending a request to add a song to a group playlist.  Thus, Toadfish was born!
